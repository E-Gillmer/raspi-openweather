# raspi-openweather
Openweathermap with the raspberry pi and a 3.5" LCD
 Raspberry pi openweather display.  This project uses the openweathermap API for weather information. 
 The script requires the Longitude and Latitude coordinates for your location. It also requires a 
 FREE  API key from openweathermap for operation. The inside temperature is obtained with a DHT22 sensor 
 connected to the Pi. The screen required is a 3.5‚Äù HDMI or a 5". The touch feature of the screen is not required 
 but is helpful to shutdown the App by clicking on the upper right corner.
